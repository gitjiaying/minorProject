ANN:
Targets:	1. Define inputs and outputs (players and enemies)
		Inputs:	Actions Player(CPU)		Outputs: Actions Enemy (player-controlled)
		Aim At Enemy (1) (0)			
		Speed towards enemy [-1, 1]		Speed from player[-1, 1]
		Meleeweapon or Fireweapon (1) (0) 	Meleeweapon or Fireweapon (1) (0)
		Jump(0) (1)				Jump (0) (1)
		crouch(0) (1)				Crouch(0) (1)
		Hide(0) (1)				Hide(0) (1)

		2. Sample Data By controlling the enemy. And Let the player be controller by either CPU or another player.
		3. Amount of inputs = amount of neurons Input layer
		   Amount of outputs = amount of neurons Output layer
		   Input neurons < Amound of hidden neurons Hidden Layer < output neurons
		4. Train the network
		5. Use the weights to perform enemy actions while playing, based on the inputs (player actions).


Input:
6 N
Hidden
6 N
Output
5 N
